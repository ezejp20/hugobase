Project Mystic is a project at BBOXX to create a framework
for providing the capability of *Process Load Testing*. This
means deploying [process tests](/post/bboxx/why-load-testing#process-testing)
in scale against a test system.

In short, this gives users access to an understanding of the performance of systems at scale.

The potential benefits to this are:

1. Present and future bottlenecks
2. Detect degradation in scability for code deploys.
