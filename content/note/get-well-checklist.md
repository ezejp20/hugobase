Recently in a therapy session I stated:

> "I could write a list of things, and if I did all of those things, I would get better."

This is that list.

- Learn.^[A language, skill, or proficiency.]
- Create.^[Music, tech, photography, baking, dancing, blog.]
- Be loving.^[Be kind. [Assume I'm loved](/note/assume-love). Regularly contact loved ones.]
- Sleep well.^[Bed is no place for backlit screens.]
- Limit rewards.^[There's a time and place for everything, and plenty for gaming and reading.]
- Express myself.^[Keep a journal, be honest, sever dependence on social media.]
- Exercise regularly.^[Real exercise, twice a week at least.]
- Take care of my body.^[Stretch, eat well, don't let injuries linger.]
