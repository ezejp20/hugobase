Suffer from heartbreak a lot?

If you assume people don't love you, you can't ever be disappointed.

You are forever protected from all woes of the heart.

Except it hurts to go through life when:

- You have a justify a reason for everyone who does love you.
- You start to believe love is an even exchange of advantage.
- You begin to stop loving yourself. 
- You start to ration your love for others.

## Love isn't finite.

## Love doesn't have reason.

## Love begets love.

## Love wants to be acknowledged.
