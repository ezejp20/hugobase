      <description>Testing is an essential part of all product development. It&amp;rsquo;s likely everything you can see right now has been extensively tested at some point. Testing for software development is just as important than testing any other product, but is often back-benched since it isn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly productive. Would you ever use an appliance that has never been tested? Drive a car?
Like it or not, if you ever want anybody to use your code with confidence, you need to write tests.</description>
